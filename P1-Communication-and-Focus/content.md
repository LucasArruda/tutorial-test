People kept calling Einstein a genius. He got frustrated and said "Genius is focus". He meant that genius to him was just being able to stay focused. For our purposes, staying focused means not getting distracted. So let's look at some strategies to stay focused and avoid distractions.

# Turn Off All Desktop Notifications

Head back over to system preferences, and click on "Notifications".

Select Mail, Messages, Discord, Slack, Calendar, and any other app that might throw a lot of notifications and mark all of their alert styles to "None".

You will still check these apps, but you will check them on your time, not because they shoot a notification at you when you are trying to focus on something else.

# WakaTime

You are here to code, and what better service could you use than a "FitBit for Coding". So we've bought you one!

WakaTime was invented by one of Captain Rainbow's friends Alan Hamlett. It gives you and your coach the ability to see exactly how much you are coding, in which languages, and on what projects.

**Step 1** - Go to [wakatime.com](https://www.wakatime.com) and register using your @students.makeschool.com email. **DO NOT SIGNUP WITH GITHUB**
**Step 2** - Go to WakaTime's [Supported Editors](https://wakatime.com/editors) page and select any and all IDE's you use. I recommend [Atom](https://wakatime.com/atom) and [Xcode](https://wakatime.com/xcode) (if you are a mobile student). Follow thsoe instructions.
**Step 3** - TEST! - Open your editor, start typing some stuff, then look in your wakatime dashboard and verify the connection has been made.

# Setting Up Music

Music can help you focus, but it can also be a distraction if you are always fiddling with it.

Take a minute to reflect on if you like to listen to music when you code, and if music is helping or hurting your level of focus.

### Things to Do

1. Listen to music without lyrics
1. Setup radio stations or playlists that you like ahead of time so you can just hit play and not be interrupted for 2-3 hours.
1. Use earbuds or over-ear headphones that block out other sound and show people that you are busy working and not to distract you.

# Email Client

Use the Mail app on your computer.

Hit `command`+`spacebar` and type "mail" and hit enter.

Hit `command`+`,` to get to settings and do the following steps:

1. Click "Accounts" and click "+"
1. Add your personal email address
1. Click "+" again and add your student email address
1. Close the settings window

### Clean Up Old Unreads

Sometimes you get a few hundred or thousand unread emails in the hole and it is impossible to mark them all as read. Take this time to start fresh and mark all your old emails as read.
