# Hiding the Dock (Maximizing Screen Space)

You paid a lot for that computer, let's get the maximum space out of the screen. First we'll hide the dock.

Use spotlight (`command`+`spacebar`) to open system preferences, and click on "Dock". Set the dock's position to the right side of the screen and set it to "Automatically hide and show the Dock".

Another trick to getting get even more space, return to system settings and go into "Display". Click on "Scaled" and choose "More Space".
