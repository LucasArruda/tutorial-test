Download and install Atom. Atom is a an open-source text editor maintained by Github, that we will use to write code.

# Atom General Settings

There's long been a religious war between proponents of tabs and spaces in source code. It's a particularly important topic in Python programming, because white space is actually part of the syntax. The Python Style Guide, known as [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) says that Python code should use only spaces, cannot mix spaces and tabs, and that code blocks should be indented by 4 spaces each.

To make sure we don't mess this up, let's have Atom help us out by emitting 4 spaces when pressing the tab key.

Go to Atom Preferences, the Settings Tab and find the Soft Tabs option. Make sure it's checked.

Then scroll down and make sure tabs emit 4 spaces:

# Embedded Terminal Window Package

Let's install a new package to our Atom instance to make it work better for us.

First we're going to get an embedded terminal in our Atom instance.

Hit `command` + `shift` + `p` and type "install package" and hit "enter". Now you are on the Install Packages settings page of Atom.

In the search bar type and install this package:

```
platformio-ide-terminal
```

To turn this terminal on and off hit `control` + `~`.

# Column Select (Many Cursors!)

Atom already lets you use multiple cursors at the same time.

Open a new file and type a Bart Simpson classic.

```
There is no such month as Rocktober
There is no such month as Rocktober
There is no such month as Rocktober
There is no such month as Rocktober
```

Now `command` + `click` anywhere on the text. You'll see you can make many cursors and make edits.

Now click on any of the "Rocktober's" and hit `command` + `shift` + `D`. You can select and edit multiple instances.

To select and edit all the instances, put your cursor on "Rocktober" and hit `command` + `ctrl` + `G`.

But what about clicking and dragging many cursors? Let's install a package for that.

Go back to the install settings page and type in this package and install it.

```
sublime-style-column-selection
```

Now go back to your Bart Simpson phrases and hold `alt` and drag down the right side. of the text. Huzzah! Many cursors.

# Atom Python Packages

*These instructions are derived from [this blog post](http://www.marinamele.com/install-and-configure-atom-editor-for-python)*.

We're going to install some packages for Atom that makes writing Python much faster by providing real-time validation of your code. In general, these programs are called *linters*.

First we'll use the Atom Package Manager to install `linter`. Linter provides a single api that all the language-specific linters can use to interact with Atom.

	$ apm install linter

*If that didn't work and you see an errorÂ like `-bash: apm: command not found`, you need to install `apm` as a shell command accessible from the Terminal. In the menu, go to Atom --> Install Shell Commands and try again.*

Next we'll install the Python linting package, which is called `flake8`. There are two components - one which is a Python package, which takes the actual Python text and checks it with the compiler. We'll install that now.

	$ pip3 install flake8
	$ pip3 install flake8-docstrings

The other component is the Atom package that acts as the glue between `flake8` and `linter` to provide Atom with the real time validation.

	$ apm install linter-flake8

Finally, we have to make some changes to Atom. First we'll change the init script that runs every time Atom is opened.

In the menu, go to Atom --> Open Your Init Script.

![Open Your Init Script](openInitScript.png)

Add the following line at the bottom:

	process.env.PATH = ['/usr/local/bin/', process.env.PATH].join(':')

Save that file.

Next we need to change a setting in the `linter-flake8` package. Go to the Atom Preferences page from the Atom menu. Click the packages menu item.

![Packages](packages.png)

Find the `linter-flake8` package and click the settings button.

*NOTE: If you don't see a settings button, try restarting Atom. Also ensure that you installed Atom into your Applications directory and that you're running that Atom.*

![linter-flake8](linterflake8.png)

Find the executable path setting:

![Executable Path Setting](executablePath.png)

To figure out where the `flake8` executable is located in our filesystem, we can use the `which` command. Go to the terminal and type:

	$ which flake8

Take the result of that command, and paste it into the exectuable path setting in Atom.

In my case, `flake8` was here:

	/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/flake8
